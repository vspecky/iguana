# Iguana
Iguana will be a simple Parser Combinator Library.

## What is a Parser Combinator?
Parsing is the process of converting unstructured data into structured data based on some rules (at least when it comes to parsing code)
and a Parser is a function that carries out this process.  
A Parser "Combinator" is simply a higher order function that takes multiple parsers and outputs a single Parser that combines the input
parsers in some way. These parsers are then called recursively when a string needs to be parsed, and this strategy is called Recursive Descent Parsing

## Examples
